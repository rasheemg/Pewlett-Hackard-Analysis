# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


Overview of the analysis: 

To assist Bobby with planning for replacing employees as they plan for retirement 
an analysis was conducted to identify all employees that are approaching retirement age.  
By identifying the employees and taking note of their titles Bobby will know which positions 
he may need to train or hire for in the next several years.

Results: 

A substantial number of people will be retiring in the next few years, our analysis puts this number at 41,380.
Most of the staff that may retire in the upcoming years are senior staff, including Senior Engineer and Senior Staff.  This indicates that the most experienced staff are retiring.
There is a substainal amount of opportunity to mentor exsiting staff to replace the more senior roles for those retiring.
The organization has the opportunity to be much more proactive in planning with this data with such a large amount of people retiring they are at risk to have major productivity issues if staff decides to retire around the same time.

Summary:

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
There will need to be 41,380 positions filled as the silver tsunami impacts the organization.

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are only 1,549 retirement-ready employees that are mentorship eligible.  
This will create a hardship for Pwelett Hackard as they try to train the next generation of employees since they will eventially need to train about 27 times the amount of people that are eligible to be mentors.  
They are behind the ball and may need to seek alternative methods for promoting employees and seeing replacements for retirees.
